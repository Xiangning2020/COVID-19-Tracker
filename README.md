# COVID-19 Tracker!

This project is a basic tracker which gives the real time COVID-19 data of different countries all over the world in the forms of statistics, table, map and line graphs. 

Website is [here](https://covid-19-tracker-xiangning.web.app/)! 

- [x] Designed three cards to show the corresponding new, recovered and death cases both daily and in total given a
selected country from a menulist.
- [x] Represented the cases of each country on a map by drawing different sized and colored circles, centered and zoomed
in the map to the position of a country when it’s selected.
- [x] Implemented responsive pop-ups to display the country’s flag, the data of total, recovered, and death cases for users
when a country is clicked on the map by utilizing Leaflet.js.
- [x] Visualized the worldwide COVID-19 cases through tables and line graphs by using Chart.js and disease.sh API to
fetch the data.

## How to start?

Download all the files except the Firebase related part, since you can deploy it in your own firebase related account!
Also you may have to change the firebase related code in the files。

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm install`
and then
### `npm start`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
